8. writing client
   redis client using streams API

9. server
   very trivial http server (no routes, 1 constant page or something like this)

   trivial protocol implementation
   protocol approach limitations

11. flow control
   transport/protocol level
   streams level

   add_reader/remove_reader, add_writer/remove_writer
   simple library without protocols (aiopg, maybe butter???)

   call_soon/call_later
   importance of timer support in event loop

Underline the fact that async code forces all your code to be async:

1. If you call coroutine use `yield from` expression.
2. If your function has `yield from` inside mark is with `@asyncio.coroutine` decorator.

Yes, using asyncio infects your code in async way: you should not use sync call which may take a while for execution.

Describe the difference between coroutine and task.

1. coroutine is like an async function: use `yield from` for calling it. 
   coro() call makes a generator instance, you should *unwind* it.
2. Task is for making new lightweight thread. Dont overuse it: tasks are cheap but not so cheap as coroutintes.
   Always *join* a task by `yield from` or other asyncio funcions.
